**Plugin Name:**  Obsidian AI Chat

**Description:** This plugin allows users to chat with an AI about the content of their Obsidian notes. The AI should be able to answer questions, summarize information, and provide insights based on the notes in the user's vault.

**Instructions for the AI:**

1. **Project Setup:**
    *   Create a new Obsidian plugin project using the latest Obsidian API. You can use the official sample plugin as a template ([https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin)).
    *   Set up the development environment with necessary dependencies (Node.js, npm/yarn, TypeScript).
    *   Configure the `manifest.json` file with appropriate plugin information (name, ID, version, author, etc.).

2. **User Interface (UI) Design:**
    *   Create a dedicated view or pane within Obsidian for the AI chat interface. This could be a sidebar pane, a modal, or a separate window.
    *   Design the chat interface with:
        *   A text input field for user queries.
        *   A display area for the chat history (both user messages and AI responses).
        *   A button or command to initiate the chat.
        *   (Optional) A button or command to clear the chat history.
        *   (Optional) Settings to configure the AI model, API key, and other preferences.

3. **AI Integration:**
    *   Choose an appropriate AI model or service for processing user queries and generating responses. Options include:
        *   OpenAI API (GPT-3, GPT-4)
        *   Cohere API
        *   Locally hosted models (e.g., using llama.cpp or similar)
        *   Other AI APIs as they become available
    *   Implement the necessary API calls to send user queries to the chosen AI model and receive responses.
    *   Handle API key management securely. Allow users to input their API key in the plugin settings. Encrypt the API key when storing it.

4. **Note Retrieval and Processing:**
    *   When a user submits a query, the plugin should:
        *   Identify the relevant notes in the user's vault based on the query. This could involve:
            *   Full-text search of all notes.
            *   Searching based on note titles, tags, or links.
            *   Using Obsidian's internal search API.
            *   Potentially using embeddings for semantic search if the chosen AI model supports it.
        *   Extract the text content from the relevant notes.
        *   Preprocess the text data (e.g., cleaning, formatting) to optimize it for the AI model.
        *   (Optional) Implement a system for chunking long notes into smaller pieces to avoid exceeding the AI model's context window.

5. **Context Management:**
    *   Provide the AI model with relevant context from the user's notes along with the user's query. This context should include:
        *   The content of the identified notes.
        *   (Optional) Information about the current note the user is viewing.
        *   (Optional) Previous messages in the chat conversation to maintain context.
    *   Develop a strategy for managing the context window to ensure that the most relevant information is provided to the AI model.

6. **Response Generation and Display:**
    *   Send the user's query and the retrieved note content to the AI model.
    *   Receive the AI's response.
    *   Format the AI's response appropriately for display in the chat interface.
    *   Display both the user's query and the AI's response in the chat history.

7. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**
    *   Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle API errors, network issues, and other potential problems.
    *   Provide informative error messages to the user.
    *   Consider edge cases, such as:
        *   No relevant notes found.
        *   The AI model returns an empty or invalid response.
        *   The user's query is ambiguous or unclear.

8. **Settings and Customization:**
    *   Allow users to customize the plugin's behavior through settings, such as:
        *   AI model selection.
        *   API key input.
        *   Temperature and other AI parameters.
        *   Appearance of the chat interface.
        *   Search preferences (e.g., which folders to include/exclude).

9. **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Thoroughly test the plugin with various queries and note content.
    *   Refine the AI integration, context management, and response generation based on testing results.
    *   Gather feedback from users and iterate on the plugin's functionality and design.

10. **Documentation:**
    *   Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for users on how to install, configure, and use the plugin.
    *   Include a guide on how to obtain an API key for the chosen AI model.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Performance Optimization:** Ensure that the plugin is performant and doesn't negatively impact Obsidian's responsiveness. Optimize note retrieval, text processing, and API calls.
*   **Security:**  Handle user data and API keys securely. Encrypt sensitive information and follow best practices for secure coding.
*   **Privacy:** Be transparent with users about how their data is being used and processed.
*   **User Experience (UX):** Design the plugin with a focus on user experience. Make it easy to use, intuitive, and helpful.

These instructions should provide a solid foundation for an AI to build the desired Obsidian plugin. Remember to iterate and refine the plugin based on user feedback and testing results.
